# dvd-rw-tools-windows
dvd+rw-tools 7.1 compiled for Windows x64 / x86

The [Win32 binaries](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/tools/win32/) provided by the author are for 6.0. I only needed this to try setting a custom spare area for a BD-RE using dvd+rw-format, which meant needing >=7.0.

I tested x64 dvd+rw-format and dvd+rw-mediainfo and both work on two machines, one with an internal SATA drive, the other with a USB BD-RE drive. YMMV.

## FAQ
### Q: Literally anything
### A: The developer hasn't updated this since 2008, you should probably ask someone that isn't me.

Please refer to the [original website](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/) for information or usage instructions.
