# dvd-rw-tools-windows
dvd+rw-tools 7.1 compiled for Windows x64 / x86

The [Win32 binaries](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/tools/win32/) provided by the author are for 6.0. I only needed this to try setting a custom spare area for a BD-R using dvd+rw-format, which meant needing >=7.0.

Please refer to the [original website](http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD+RW/) for information or usage instructions.
